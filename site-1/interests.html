            <h2>My Life Outdoors</h2>
            <h3>Hiking in the Mountains</h3>
            <img src="../Resources/hiking.jpg" height=280 width=450 alt="Mountains">
            <figcaption>One of my best friends and I posing at the top of a mountain in Asheville.</figcaption>
            <p>I grew up in Asheville, North Carolina. My childhood and teenage years consisted of a lot of hiking. There are no mountains in Chapel Hill, but my dog and I love to discover new trails around RTP.</p>
            <h3>Waterfalls</h3>
            <img src="../Resources/waterfall.jpg" height=380 width=280>
            <figcaption>My favorite area to hike in Asheville, triple falls.</figcaption>
            <p>There are several natural waterfalls in Asheville. For long hikes, waterfalls and streams are a useful source of water. Once, I went on a hike that I thought would be 3 miles long but ended up being 10 miles, so I didn't bring enough water. Thankfully, there were plenty of streams and waterfalls to stock up.</p>
            <h3>Climbing</h3>

            <figcaption>My cousins and I climbing in Thailand.</figcaption>
            <p>I've only ever been outdoor rockclimbing once. However, this was one of my most memorable experiences, and I would love to go back again!</p>

            <h2>Traveling</h2>
            <p>I'm the type of person who doesn't enjoy traveling unless it's with people who are closest to me. I've been on several trips with my partner and dog during undergrad. We are planning to go camping with two of our closest friends during Spring Break 2018!</p>
            <h3>California</h3>
